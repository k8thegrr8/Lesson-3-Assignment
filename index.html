            <h4>Fancy Restaurant Group SmartPhone App</h4>
            <img src="images/KellyLogo2-768x768%20(1).png" alt="Fancy Restaurant Group logo" height="200">
            <p>This project assignment was to create a prototype smartphone app using Figma. My goal was to create a restaurant reservation app that allowed users to make reservations easily from their smartphone or other device. It eliminates the need for phone calls and allows users to book tables at their preferred restaurants at their convenience.</p>
            <p>My design concept was to make something super simple to use to create reservations to three fictitious fancy restaurants in Raleigh.</p>
